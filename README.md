# leaflet-challenge
This project is part of Module 15 Challenge of the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description
### Problem
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Files supplied
 - GeoJSON dataset
 - index.html file
 - logic.js file
 - style.css file

### Deliverables
1. Using Leaflet, create a map that plots the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude
2. Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in colour.
